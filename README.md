# IT Scripts

A tiny, portable collection of **POSIX sh** scripts for everyday tasks.  
No dependencies beyond a standard Unix-like environment.

## Quick start

### Run locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Franky5831/IT-Scripts.git
cd IT-Scripts
```

---

## Scripts catalog
| Title | Read More | Short description |
|-|-|-|
| **apache&#8209;instantiate** | [/scripts/&#8288;apache&#8209;instantiate](./scripts/apache-instantiate/) | Quickly creates and enables an Apache vhost on the next free port, scaffolds a docroot and index page, and reloads Apache. |
> More scripts are on the way - feel free to propose one via an issue or PR.

## Philosophy
- **Portable first**: prefer POSIX sh; keep dependencies standard.
- **Readable**: clear naming, comments for non-obvious logic.
- **Safe by default**: fail fast; ask before destructive actions.

## How to test (Docker)
This repo includes a Dockerfile so you can try scripts in a clean, disposable container - great for testing without changing your host.
```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t script-tester .

# Run the container
docker run -it --rm script-tester
# If a script exposes a port (e.g., Apache), publish it
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 script-tester
```
